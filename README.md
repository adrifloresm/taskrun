taskrunpy
=========

An easy-to-use python package for running tasks with dependencies and process management

For colored output, this package uses termcolor-1.1.0. The code runs without termcolor,
however, if you want colored output, termcolor needs to be installed. To install termcolor,
run the following commands:

~> wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/t/termcolor/termcolor-1.1.0.tar.gz

~> tar zxvf termcolor-1.1.0.tar.gz

~> sudo ./setup.py install
